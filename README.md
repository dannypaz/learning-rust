# Learning-Rust

* Look into Manjaro for OS :)
* Use crates.io to find different libraries

1. Run your code
```
cargo run
```

2. Format your code
```
cargo fmt
```

Cleaning the entire everything (cache, docs, stuff)
```
cargo clean
```

Creating test... use the macro `#[test]`
Watch out for disk space... cache for rust can get ridiculously big
