# Learning-Rust

* Look into Manjaro for OS :)
* Use crates.io to find different libraries

1. Run your code
```
cargo run
```

2. Format your code
```
cargo fmt
```

Cleaning the entire everything (cache, docs, stuff)
```
cargo clean
```

Creating test... use the macro `#[test]`
Watch out for disk space... cache for rust can get ridiculously big
By default... everything is private in a rs file... you have to be explicit about what functions are public for a module.

Create a library `cargo new <project> --lib` (uses the library template)
